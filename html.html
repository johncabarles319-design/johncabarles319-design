            <p class="description">
                I am a Computer Science student, and I'm 19 years old. I live in Bago Gallera, Davao City, and currently study at the University of Mindanao with a deep passion for technology. 
                I am driven by how technology is changing our lives and am committed to being part of that change. 
                I have expertise in programming, with a focus on mastering C++ and Java, and my career goal is to become a web developer. 
                I am particularly interested in creating engaging, responsive websites that combine functionality with aesthetic design, allowing me to express both my technical skills and creativity.
